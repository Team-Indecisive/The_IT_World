									<p>Entering into this project we were under the misapprehension that I’m sure many are under that there would be an easy way to draw a line between a good charity that use their donations in an ethical manor and a bad one. A simple A+B= ethical charity equation. Unfortunately, after much research it became evident that this would not be possible. The patches of grey were too large to find the black and white surrounding.  The best way I could think to sidestep this kink in the road would be to provide our users with a few bits of information that we’ve come across so that you can make educated decision on how you want to share your hard-earned money.</p>
									<br>
									<h4>Administartive Costs</h4>
									<p>I know I’ve seen it and I’m sure you have too. That tiny little print down the bottom of the donation box or envelopes say only a tiny percentage of this will actually reach the intended recipient. It’s disheartening to say the least. But did you know that in Australia und 50% of charity work is done by volunteers? Keeping this in mind it’s important to consider is that work these charities are doing more valuable because of the paid professionals required to provide the service. For example, consider a charity that provides medical care to rural Australians. As well as medical equipment medical professionals such as doctors and nurses will be required. These medical professionals will need to be paid at a higher rate than those who work in say a charity shop who may also be paid workers for a charity. Therefore, the first charity will need to spend a larger percentage of donations than the charity shop. For this reason, administrative costs are an unfortunate necessity of charity work and cannot be used to decide whether charity is using its funds in an ethical manner.</p>
									<br>
									<h4>Marketing Costs</h4>
									<p>Another contentions issue in the charity world is Marketing. Marketing is essential element for all charities but particularly new charities starting out. I mean think about it, how will you give money to a charity if you don’t know they exist? Another thing to keep in mind when it comes to marketing in charities is that there are some causes out there that are more popular than others meaning those less sexy charities may need to spend more to make more. Once again this doesn’t necessarily make these charities worse, it just means they have the need to attract supporters.</p>
									<br>
									<p>I hope this helps you make the right choice when it comes to sharing your good fortune around and thanks for all your charitable contributions.</p>
