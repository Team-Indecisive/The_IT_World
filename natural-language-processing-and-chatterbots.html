									<h3>What does it do? </h3>

									<h5>What is the state-of-the-art technology? </h5>

									<p>Natural language processing or NLP is the bridging between human language and computer language allowing computers to make sense of the complexities of what a person may say, and to respond with something a person could understand. There are 4 main types of NLP, sentimental analysis (an example of this is the like button and other expressions of emotions you will find on social media sights), speech recognition like Siri on the iPhone or google assistant devices and machine translation like language translation apps. The fourth type is chatbots. There are 6 steps in the development of natural language, these are:</p>

									<p>•	Tokenisation – The first step of natural language processing, tokenisation cuts the sentence into smaller sections called ‘tokens’ and removes parts of the text that may cause confusion like punctuation. Although this step seems quite simple it can be confused by elaborate text such as hyphenated words.</p>

									
									<p>•	Stemming – This is the second step in NLP and removes the suffix from words to turn different forms of a word into one word. For example, the words running, runner, runs and ran could all be reduced to the single present form stem word of ‘run’. This process uses the Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK provided by Python. </p>

																      
																      <p>•	Lemmatisation- Lemmatisation is the process or reducing the amount of words by grouping together different inflicted forms into a root word referred to called ‘Lemma’. Lemmatisation differs slightly to stemming in that it required detailed dictionaries in order to group words. Where stemming would group together gone and going into go, lemmatisation would also include words like went.</p>

																      <p>•	POS tags- Pos tags assign a letter value to different grammatical terms such as, nouns, verbs and adjectives. </p>

																      <p>•	Named entity recognition (NER) – NER recognises noun phrases within a text that by detecting subject to object relationships, then extracting just the subject. For example, in the sentence ‘Marc travelled to Spain last week, the named entities in this statement would be ‘Marc’ and ‘Spain’. </p>

																      <p>•	Chunking- The final step of chunking allows for phrases to be grouped together when the meaning would be changed by the separation of the words. It is particularly useful with regards to people’s names and places, for example ‘South America’ has a different meaning to ‘South’, ‘America’.</p>


																      <p>Chatbots as stated above is one of the 4 main uses of NLP. It can simulate regular conversation as if you were speaking to a person through a website or phone call. Essentially a chatbot will receive an input from a user and return an output or a response to the user’s request. To be effective a chatbot needs to be able to perform both these tasks and deliver useful information to the user. </p>


																      <h5>What can be done now? </h5>

																      <p>Some real-world applications of NLP that most people would be familiar with include:</p>

																      <p>•	Email Filters- the ability to prevent spam from reaching a person’s inbox is one of the first and well-known uses of NLP. Google has taken it a step further and developed a system where emails are categorised as either, primary, social or promotional to cut down on clutter for users.</p>

																      <p>•	Smart assistants- although still in their formative years devices such as google assistant and Alexa have the capability to turn lights and the television on and off as well as heaters and even with the right technology close curtains and blinds, all with the sound of your voice.</p>

																      <p>•	Predictive text- we are so familiar with autocorrect and predictive text it feels as though we never lived without them. This technology uses what you have typed to guess what you wish to say next. It will even learn from you and customise itself to your specific requirements. </p>

																      <p>•	Digital phone calls- we’ve all experienced that machine generated “your call will be recorded for training and development purposes.” This technology has become essential for large scale businesses that may not have the capability for humans to answer every phone call. </p>


																      <h5>What is likely to be able to be done soon? </h5>

																      <p>Although the development of NLP technologies has increased massively over the last 5 years the possibilities for the future predicted to be massive, with faster chatbots, smarter personal assistants and machines that can have regular conversations with humans. It is also predicted that NLP will be diversifying into industries it has not previously been used in such as insurance, finance, risk and compliance. </p>


																      <h5>What technological developments make this possible? </h5>

																      <p>One of the most useful development tools is the integration into a vast array of devices from smart assistants, to mobile phones and laptops, to fridges. Experts predict that the improvement of speech recognition technologies will be huge, and the development of these technologies come from use. </p>


																      <h3>What Is the likely impact? </h3> 

																      <h5>What is the potential impact of this development? </h5>

																      <p>Although NLP has been warmly accepted by a large part of the population there is also controversy surrounding the use of NLP especially in the fight for privacy in an increasingly unrestricted world. Microsoft found themselves in hot water as they engineered technology that could collaboratively use searches from a search engine to diagnose colon cancer in sufferers who had not yet been diagnosed. However, the diagnoses turned out not to be 100% accurate causing people unnecessary emotional stress.  </p>

																      <h5>What is likely to change? </h5>

																      <p>Developments within the medical industry will contribute massively to easing discomfort of those suffering from medical conditions or injuries, as well as easing the stress on healthcare workers. I studied nursing for a year and during placement experienced first-hand the pressure that those working in aged care homes are put under. This technology could take away some of the menial tasks from care providers and give them the time to provide a higher level of care to residents. </p>


																      <h5>Which people will be most affected and how? </h5>

																      <p>Despite the afore mentioned hiccup with Microsoft’s colon cancer mishap, I think with development technology could have positive applications within medical applications.  </p>


																      <h5>Will this create replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h5> 
The job of data scientist is currently the development of NLP technologies however it is possible that in the future the technology will become so advanced that human data scientist will become obsolete.  
  

																      <h3>How will this affect you? </h3> 

																      <h5>In your daily life how will this affect you? </h5>

																      <p>Personally, I use NLP on a regular basis. I am woken in the morning by the alarm on my google assistant. I check my emails which have been scanned for spam by a spam filter. Then I check social media and will express my opinion on some of my friend’s posts using like buttons. Then I might decide to go for a run, so I ask Google what the weather is outside. At some point during the day I might need to call my bank as I want to open a new account with them. At nighttime I use my google assistant to turn on the lights and ask to google to play some music. A little later in the night I might want to watch TV, so I ask Google to turn on the TV. In my everyday life NLP has made my day substantially easier.  </p>


																      <h5>What will be different for you? </h5>

																      <p>As I stated above, I have thoroughly embraced NLP and I am excited to trial new technologies as new developments are made. Although I appreciate the developments that have occurred over the last few years.  I’ve been driven mad by digital phone calls as I’m sure many have, the technology in this area is not yet perfect and I hope that in the future this area of NLP will be developed so that users don’t find those phone calls quite so frustrating.  </p>
 
 


																      <h5>How might this affect members of your family and friends? </h5>

																      <p>I find my google assistant so useful I purchased my family google assistants for Christmas this year and even my 64-year-old dad was thrilled with it so much so that he has since bought one of the larger units. I think this technology could be helpful to older people when the technology becomes more developed. Companies that work in assisting the elderly could make great use of this technology by developing programmes that can work through a personal assistant. It could be used to ask for assistance after a fall, to request a meal delivery through meals on wheels or similar programmes or to request a care giver come provide some assistance. </p>
