									<h2>Our Story</h2>
									<p>	
										Started by a small group of young and innovative students, our business has gone from being a small idea about the possibilities and potential accomplishments that could be achieved through the amazing medium that is the internet. 
										To a fully fledged non-for-profit business with a number of active charities being supported by our amazing donators.
										This idea was fed by our shared appreciation of our lifestyles, our opportunities for our education and seeing just how different our lives are from a large number of people spread out across our very own home country.

									<h2>What we created</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Logo-Extra.jpg" alt="" /></span>Choice Charities is a online non-for-profit that hosts a platform that users can use to easily browse a variety of different charities which support all kinds of different community works and public services such as wildlife conservation, helping the homeless, environmental conservation works, feeding hungry children and much more. With all of our charities ran from within Australia.</p>

									<h2>How have we helped?</h2>
									<p><p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ThankYou.jpg" alt="" /></span>Over the past few months since the launch of our site, our amazing donators have managed to work together and have donated a collaborative effort of over $10,000 to a variety of charities. This is an incredible achievement, and we are completely humbled to see the level of generosity that the Australian public are capable of! After this initial success we are even more motivated to make this platform blossom into an even wider reaching community, this is why we are now using the percentage of donations that you have donated to us to invest in greater advertising on a wider range of platforms. </p></p>
