									<h2>Team Profile</h2>
									<h3>Team Name:</h3>
									<p>Choice Charities.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Personal Information:</h3>
									<p><b>Nathan Askew - S3720643</b></p>
									<p>I was born in England and moved over to Australia when I was 7, while in Australia I have completed all high schooling through VCE and also undertook a VET subject at the Gordon which got me a partial completion of a cert 3 in information, digital media and technology. I then moved into university and began studying a Bachelor of Business in information systems. I am now in my final semester of a three-year degree.</p>
									<p>Outside of study I enjoy spending time in Discord chatting with mates online and playing a few games such as CS:GO, Overwatch, RimWorld, Dirt Rally 2.0, etc. When the Weather is good, I am often out taking my dogs for a walk or working in the yard, when it is crapy whether I am normally out in the shed working on one of many different projects. Weather that is fixing my car (again) or working on some old farm machinery or fixing up an old dirt bike. If it is mechanical or has an engine, I am more than happy to tinker with it and try to get the thing going. However, this normally has varying levels of success.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Tom Marshman - s3666127</b></p>
									<p>I was born in Melbourne and have lived here all my life. My grandparents on my mother’s side are originally from Morphu, Cypress. They moved here in the 50s. A few years agon I was lucky enough to travel there with them to see where they grew up.</p>
									<p>I currently hold an Advanced Diploma in Accounting. I have been working as a bookkeeper / junior accountant now in a small accounting firm for around 4.5 years. My tasks include simple to medium level tax returns, as well as other things.</p>
									<p>My passion is music. I play the drums in a rock band called Tomorrow’s Sky. We have just released out first album and have played many gigs around Melbourne.</p>
									<p>I am also a punter when it comes to music. I really like to go and see cover bands. Some of my favourites are: Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, AC DC, Deep Purple. Melbourne has a vibrant cover music scene.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Geoffrey Timothy - s3829305</b></p>
									<p>I was born in Indonesia, a country located nearby Australia. I have been living in Indo for around 18 years which is my whole life. I am a fresh high school graduate and continuing my education straight to the university. I have been to Melbourne twice for vacation. Studying at RMIT will be the first time for me to gain education abroad.</p>
									<p>Playing musical instrument has always been my hobby since I was in Junior High. I joined the band extracurricular and had few gigs with my friend for school’s occasions. I can play bass, guitar and drums. I also really hope to enhance my skill as the time goes by. I enjoy listening to jazz and pop music.</p>
									<p>Talking about experiences in IT, I could say I have zero experience in it because as I said I am a high school graduate and there were only two education pathways in Indonesia either to choose studying Social or Science. My prior school provided me with some IT basics lesson, but I think it was not university level IT. It was only how to use some certain apps such as SketchUp and some Video editing applications. My interest in IT came when I was wondering about the future and realised that nowadays world is all about technology. There is also a large job field regarding to the IT world.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Adair Grant - s3872722</b></p>
									<p>I was born and have lived in Melbourne my whole life with everyone from my family coming from Australia going back 4 generations. My 5th great-grandmother was even sent to Tasmania as convicts from Ireland in 1813 as was my 3rd grandfather in 1850. I finished school in 2008 and soon settled into a career in the airline industry first as a domestic flight attendant for Jetstar, then as an international flight attendant with Qantas. I operated the last flight into Qantas operated from LAX to Melbourne on the 30th of March and have been stood down ever since.</p>
									<p>I have a passion for travel and was planning to visit my 30th country this year for my 30th birthday however this plan was uprooted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also interested in anything fashion or beauty related and I used to love making my own formal outfits and costumes. My experience with IT is very limited and basically consists of a basic understanding and what I have learnt in the last 6 months. I decided to pursue an education in IT soon after being stood down at Qantas as I couldn’t find employment that interested me that I was qualified for. I decided I needed to give myself some options and that IT is an area that will always provide opportunities for me.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Dillon Foenander - s3484430 </b></p>
									<p>My name is Dillon Foenander, I am currently undertaking an undergraduate course at RMIT University with my major being Business Information Systems (BP308) , and Specifically Introduction to Information Technology (COSC1078) as an Elective in my Final Year and have completed Many IT and Business Subjects Alike.</p>
									<p>My Interest in Information Technology Started at a young age, when I started playing video and computer games. From Pokémon Gold on my first handheld device, Gameboy colour to Atlantis on my first Video Gaming Console, PlayStation one, It amazed me how worlds could be built into a device for you to explore endlessly, this of course led to a passion in all Things Technology; in General, could do, especially when code was involved.</p>
									<p>Turning words into actual computer processes such as the things that happened within certain applications such as paint and full three-dimensional worlds in games like croc and Spyro (3D action adventure games) piqued my interest Which led me to take IT specific courses in Both High School and University; Information Technology Certificate ¾ as well as Interactive Digital Media Certificate ¾.</p>
									<p>Within a workplace and in my everyday life; I have worked in the IT Sector as a Website Administrator as well as within the retail Industry selling IT Specific Products and Services.</p>
									<p>I hope to use this later in life to pursue a career as a Business Analyst or any other job associated such, my learning and participation in work activities within the Sector I Hope to and Has thus far helped me acquire skills and knowledge Which are both empowering and Interesting at the same time.</p>

									<h2>Project Description – Choice Charities</h2>
Our aim is to build a website that helps people to donate to charity.  The functionality will be a website with an image of Australia.  The user will be able to pick a charity of their choosing by clinking on the relevant location on the map of Australia.<br>
As far as choosing a charity goes, the site will be incredibly transparent.  The user will be able to see exactly where their donation is going.  For instance, some charities will put a certain percentage of their donation income to “administrative fees” instead of actually going to the needy.  Which is where they claim that the proceeds will go.<br>
This idea originated with Nathan Askew in his assignment one.  He came up with the idea.  Before choosing Nathan’s idea, all of the team members pitched their idea to each other.  All of the ideas seemed interesting and doable.  For instance, there was a makeup app, a bookkeeping app, an ap about sneakers and an app with regards to help student study.<br>
We chose Choice Charities because it seemed doable but also because it is very altruistic and would make a positive impact on the world by trying to give help to those people in need.<br>
There are a few websites already out there that are similar such as Givit, GiveNow and Australia Charity Guide.  Our site will be more user friendly and more transparent.<br>
Nathan and Dillon are in their final year of University study.  They are much closer to getting an IT job, compared to Adair, Geoffrey, and Tom.<br>
Our idea career paths are:<br>
•	Nathan Askew		Senior Systems Engineer<br>
•	Tom Marshman		AI research<br>
•	Adair Grant		Front end developer<br>
•	Dillon Foenander	Full Stack developer<br>
•	Geoffrey Timothy	IT Entrepreneur<br>
Creating a functioning website that helps people choose charities would be very beneficial for our career plans.  The strongest factor is that it would show that we have good communication skills.  Communication skills are most in demand skills for being an IT professional.  This is followed by teamwork skills and time management skills.  Actual technical skills are further down the list.  Therefore Choice Charities would help us with our career goals.<br>
<br>
Each of us have chosen different part of the report and the actual artifact to work on.  We have divvied up profile, tools, project description, overview, aims, plans, roles, testing, scope and limits, tools and technologies, timeframe, risks and group progress.<br>
It is likely that we wont be able to finish our project by Sunday the 18th of October.  However, with proper planning, scoping a risk management, we will be able to pass the project on to another team it we have to, due to professional planning and documentation.<br>
This example of delegation is similar to what would happen in the professional IT world, so it is giving us concrete experience for us to find a job when we graduate.<br>
<br>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Overview</h2>
Our project is to develop a website that will enable users to find a wide variety of charity works, conservation efforts, community projects or other crowd funded projects across Australia. These charities and projects will be displayed on our site after they have been identified as an honest and impactful charity through an analysis conducted by our team. By doing this, people can open our site, browse across a country map, view a wide variety of charity works, knowing that all these charities are going to put their donations to good use and be used for the purpose that they have detailed.<br>
The best part of the app is that it will provide the donor will all the information they need to pick the most suitable charity for them. The app will show the user all the relevant information about a selected charity. It will show them exactly where their money is going and how the charity uses that money. For example; how much money actually goes to those in need and how much money goes into the charity for things like advertising. This will give the donor piece of mind. Also, if this app is successful, it will increase the amount of money that goes to needing charities. This is because people of the public will be able to make a better and more personal decision about where their money is going. They will also be more aware of charities that suit them and that need money.<br>
<br><h3>Motivation</h3>
In Australia, there are over 56,000 registered charities. These range from education, health, religion, human rights, animal welfare, the environment and social welfare. There are many philanthropic people in Australia who want to donate to a specific charity but are either uneducated to which charity is best for them. Or they are so overwhelmed by the number of charities in Australia, that they don’t know where to start. There are some people that chose to donate to charity as it is a deductable expense on their income tax statement.<br>
There is also currently a huge amount of distrust with charities across Australia. This is partially due to several large charities taking in millions of dollars of donations for the 2019/2020 summer bushfires relief and large portions of these donations were not being sent to though that needed immediate help. In fact, the Australian Red-cross director Noel Clements admitted that of the $115million donated by Australians and internationally at least $11million would be used for ‘administration costs’, and in May the red cross had only distributed 40% of the money they had received with the Salvation Army having only passed on $19 million of the $41 million raised. This is one of the reasons that this website will help. It will give donors an accurate indication of where their money is really going.<br>
This is a very admirable and noble cause as it is based around registered charities that support the needy.  If this project is successful, more people will have access to donate to charities that matter to them.  On success of this project, it would show future employers that we are honest people who want to make a positive impact on the world.  Not only this but it would show employers that we have the skills to work functionally within a team and that we have organisational and time management skills.  Also we have skills to build a functioning website application.<br>
<br><h3>Landscape</h3>
There are already similar products available at the moment.  Humble Bundle lets you choose where you money will go.  Such as publishers’ charities or humble tip.<br>
Give now (givenow.com.au) can find a cause you care about with search fields and categories.  Categories such as agriculture, animal welfare, arts, community, education, environment, health, human rights.<br>
Givit (www.givit.org.au) lets you donate funds to different charities, with categories such as covid 19, indigenous support, drought relief.  Givit also has the option of donating support to the actual website, which is an idea we had with Choice Charities.<br>
Australian Charity Guide is another similar site where you can find a charity you are interested in.  Again, animal welfare, children, homelessness, health, human rights, LGBTI and victims of disaster.<br>
The main difference between these current Australian donation websites and Choice Charitie is that Choice Charities will be far more user friendly, functional, and transparent.<br>
Choice Charities will have a map of Australia showing the location of each charity.  The other thing that separates our website from the others is that we will have information for each charity with information about where the money is going, i.e. administration costs or advertisement costs.<br>
If successful, Choice charities will be a leading web application that helps connect donors with charities.<br><br>

									<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
										<h3>Aims</h3>
Our main objective is to utilize our skill sets to better our country in a way that lets experts do the work that they specialize in, as we realise that while we could make contributions through physical work such as volunteering, we may be able to help more by working in a digital setting. We would achieve this by focusing on providing and developing a web-based platform to promote and share charities and community projects across Australia, thus making it simple and easy for users to make donations and contributions to a variety of works going on around the country.<br>
To achieve this goal there will be a road of challenges to overcome, to be able to navigate this road we will need a plan to guide us and make sure we know where we are heading, what we have completed and what we still need to get done. <br>
									•	Our first main task will be to develop a detailed and concise timeframe detailing the task that will need to be completed to achieve our goal. This timeframe will need to include information such as, who will be completing which tasks, how long they should take, when they should be completed by, how they will need to be implemented and incorporated with the other tasks, and more. Once we have this timeframe, we will be able to keep on track and make sure we are well within our deadlines.<br>
									•	The next milestone will be to develop a series of wireframe mock-ups that we can use to build our project based off. These will be relatively simple in nature but will provide valuable insight into how our site will be laid out, how it will function on a basic level and also give us as creators a tangible goal or objective that we can see and work towards. This will also have the added advantage of functioning as artifacts to show how we have progressed.<br>
									•	After this we will have to turn our attention to beginning to form this into an actual site, this will most likely first entail either developing a temple or acquiring one from online. Once this is done, we can start making this template represent our previously created wireframe mock-ups. This will make the site presentable and provide insight to potential investors or stakeholders of how our final product will look, as well as enabling us to acquire feedback on potential changes or improvements that we can make.<br>
									•	Once the site looks the part, we can then focus on functionality. This component will most likely be quite time consuming as it will require us to do a great deal of developing, coding, troubleshooting, debugging and then finally, implementing it into our site. Depending on how much time we use completing the previous objectives we may even struggle to get the site fully operational before our deadline. In the event that this does happen, we will need to priorities our key functionalities and possibly cut out unnecessary features, however if we can stick to our timeframe and manage our workload effectively we should be able to achieve our mission on time.<br>
									<br>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
									<p><b>First of all,</b> let me introduce you all to my team called Team Choice Charities. 
									   	We call it Choice Charities just simply because it is the name of our Project that we’re going to work on. 
										As we know, everything that happened in life will remain as a story that can be told someday later. 
										This writing will be about a story of my great team. 
										The way we met each other will be the fun part of this little story of us. 
										Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, we need to study and work entirely from home even for me, I need to experience the very first time of university just from here, my home country, Indonesia. 
										We need to work at our best despite the fact there is a pandemic striking. 
										Therefore, all of us met just through video calls that we consider as meetings for more professional term. 
										Dividing tasks, setting deadlines and helping each others will be the key to successfully turn the Project Idea into reality. 
                                                                                <br>
										<b>Enough Introduction,</b> now let’s move on to the project that we are going to work on which will become an “artifact”. 
										At the beginning, each member come with different and broad range of ideas. 
										After thinking and contemplating for sometimes, we finally decided to go with Nathan’s idea which is a website about charity programs in Australia. 
										Basically, the functionality of the site will not have any huge difference with other existing sites. 
										It will be able to distribute certain amount of money to those who are in need. 
										As this is a charity website that aims for Australians, it will collect data to show the details of charities held all around Australia. 
										Moreover, there will be some specific functions that will differentiate ours with existing ones and the first function is the ability to specifically track where the money donated goes to and what is it used for. 
										In brief, you are in control of your money and it is assured that the money is used wisely. 
										Transparency is the main thing we want to demonstrate in this project. 
										We even planned to attach the map of Australia to clearly show where exactly every charity are held and we will put pins on the map as a mark for each charity. 
										Another feature will be a thing we call the “Humble Bonus”, and this is about some certain amount of bonus you will get after participating in one or more charities. 
										One of possible outcomes of this project is a connectivity between the charity world and the IT world because I really do believe if our project website becomes real, it will create a huge and great impact to humanity. 
										It will help people to concretely practice how to be a humble person and unconsciously give hopes of life to others. 
										There might be a chance that we will expand the website to support charities all over the world and not only in Australia – only time will tell.  
										<br>
										<b>“So far everything went really well.”</b>
										The words that I would say about our progress. 
										Most of the tasks that each of us has are in the same level with our skills so we do not really struggle with most parts of the assignment. 
										One challenging part of this last assignment is the prototyping because we need to do it with Javascript(JS). 
										A prototype is not just simply a website containing reports and hard coded things. 
										It is something that capable to interact with user and do several specific functions. 
										Hence, it is somehow will be the hardest part of this assignment – the reason why we call them as an “artifact”. 
										Before creating the prototype, we need to be settled with all of the contents required in the specification so it is more likely to say that prototyping will be the last stage of the project. 
										For now, we are still at the initial stage of the project which is the content fulfilling where each of us are doing our individual parts. 
										Parts here mean the whole thing in the specification divided into equal pieces which each member works on according to what piece they have chosen. 
										A way that we use to ease the part dividing is to place each member to the same role in A2 so that we do not get confused on picking each of our part. 
										We also use a web template for this final project. 
										Me myself has roles to work on the Tools and Technologies part and obviously in writing this Plan and Progress section. 
										To be honest, it is a little bit challenging for me to write this up because I am not really good at writing. 
										It is not a dead-end anyway because I could still try my best to construct this particular section. 
										Moreover, the stage when we will really gather to do a task is the prototyping because I’m pretty sure it will need more effort than any part of this assignment.
										<br>
										<b>About Handing the Project to successors,</b> we need to completely firm with our idea and what really is the vision of this project. 
										Successors’ roles will only simply continuing what we had done beforehand. 
										If I will be one of the successors, I will definitely ask for what is the aim and vision of the project. 
										A reason why I will ask this as early as possible is to respect the predecessors’ goal so they will be sure that their project is going to the right direction. 
										Another thing I will ask is how they usually progress with the project. 
										Knowing how they work will lead the successors to imitate the efficiency they had before. 
										Last thing will be what are the tools and technologies they used. 
										By using the same tools and technologies, successors will get the same capabilities with predecessors or even more to complete the project. 
										However, they will still need to learn at initial and get used to the tools in order to enhance their skills. 
										<br>
										<b>End of words,</b> the project has brought us to ups and downs. 
										Even though we barely found any trouble or miscommunication, there might be some invisible downs that each teammate feels. 
										One essential lesson we learn in this project is how to co-operate with team at our best. 
										Real challenge such as the fact that a pandemic is in front of us and it is blocking us to directly meet each other can’t be resisted. 
										Nevertheless, the big challenges will just make us even a better person because we will already have passed them at the end of this project. 
										Lastly, I just want to say thank you to Team Choice Charities for being supportive, for being good and for being the best for us.
										I hope this is not awkward because we all do know each team has their own story. </p>

									<h3>Roles</h3>
									Roles
Although roles have not been designated specifically, we have found that as a group our dynamic works well in a specific way.
									<strong>Nathan Askew and Dillon Foenander </strong> have more web development experience, and therefore are Leading the Development/coding of the Website, and exploring the technologies used to build it. 
									<strong>Adair Grant, Geoffrey Timothy, and Thomas Marshman </strong> are Committed to Mainly research of the overall charity and are Junior Web Developers on the Project. 
All group members have taken an equal Part in creating Mockups and Wireframes for how the user interface will run, as we all have experience with what works well in todays climate, when it comes to How using a well designed user interface, creates trust for the user and service/product. 
We have chosen to take a less formal, “Lasseiz Faire” approach to the roles designated within our group so that we can all have an equal input and wide scope of interaction with the Project. 

									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>We all do know that to achieve goals there are sweats and tears behind them.
									   	As well as a technology, it needs tools and some technology in order to make it happen. 
									   	Tools and Technologies are more like the back-end of this Charity Website. 
								           	Here are some tools and technologies we need:  
									   	<br>
										<strong>Tools:</strong><br>

										<b>1. GitHub/Visual Studio,</b><br>
										We will be using GitHub or Visual Studio as these applications are compatible for team projects and what we are most familiar with. 
										Moreover, these apps provide free local hosting service for working and updating the web while in the developing process.  
										<br>
										<b>2. Text Editor (Notepad ++, Atom.io, etc)</b><br>
										This tool is very essential in the making of this project because editor is like the control panel of our website.
										The code, page layout and functions are everything set in the text editor. 
										In other words, without this tool we can’t edit the appearance and how our website works. 
										<br>
										<b>3. Open Source Template</b><br>
										We are planning to use template for our website instead of creating it from scratch.
										However, it is way easier to use templates because we already got the design, and it is only matter of changing the text inside it. Templates usually come with both HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in them.<br>
										<b>(html5up.com/templated.co)</b>
										<br>
										<b>4. Bootstrap</b><br>
										Bootstrap is to provide functions in our website. 
										In order to make our website more interactive and arranged this tool is very essential.
										By collaborating it with the text editor, we will get maximum function of this tool called Bootstrap.<br>
										<b>(bootstrap4.com)</b>
										<br>
										<b>5. JavaScript</b><br>
										This tool is actually part of the Bootstrap tool above.
										One of Bootstrap’s components to be exact and it supports bootstrap to perform its best. 
										<br>
										<br>
										<strong>Technologies:</strong><br>
										<b>1. Website Hosting Service (GitHub)</b><br>
										After all is done and we are sure that the website is adequately developed, the next step is to think about using a Web Hosting Service.
										A service that allows us to release the website we made to public so that everybody all around the world can see and surf in our web.   
										<br>
										<b>2. Clouds (GitHub)</b><br>
										The Cloud technology held a huge role in this web making since we are using GitHub for our project. 
										Pushing and Pulling works to the GitHub repository in GitHub app is one example of the Cloud technology.  
										<br>
										<b>3. Planner (Trello) </b><br>
										We use Trello to keep up with each of our work.
										This is to keep the group well-organized because each teammate can track their own corresponding work and see how they are progressing.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>The answer is no,</b> there will not be any licensed product or tools that we are going to use for the semi-functional prototype.
										However, there are 3 main things we are going to manipulate:
										<br>
										<b>1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b><br>
										A programming language that usually used in web development.
										It has the functionality to construct the website contents. 
										<br>
										<b>2. JavaScript</b><br>
										A programming language that we use to control the behaviour of the site.
										In other words, it is the breath of the website because it creates interactions between the website and users. 
										<br>
										<b>3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b><br>
										An element that we will manipulate for the page layout styling.
										It has the functionalities to arrange things in our website (more to the design matters) and to make the site looks pretty.
										<br>
										<br>
										There is no additional hardware needed to actually construct the Website other than our personal computer because we will majorly use online services provided by the free hosting companies (GitHub).
										Our prior experience with the tools listed here before was decently great.
										It is due to some of us are still new to this technology and also a first semester student.
										In this assignment, I think we will have a better understanding because we already get more familiar with GitHub and stuffs.

									<h3>Testing</h3>
									<p>
									We will be undertaking two different types of testing for Quality Assurance, Namely White and Black Box to make sure testing has some variation, during different Phases of our Project.</p>
<p>No testing needs to take place, within the first stage of the Project as it is mainly Surveying and Brainstorming on a User Interface Design. </p>
<p>During the Alpha stage within the First Few Weeks of the program, while we only have a prototype, We will run through Acceptance Testing, making sure all functions of the website work using a planned set of instructions to make sure all pre-defined functions work, Close Friends and Family members can assist with Black Box testing (testing without knowing the parameters of the of the software)  and off course the group ourselves who will be white box testers. Ad-Hoc Testing is also Essential during this time as it is without reference and unplanned use of the software to make sure any unknown glitches and software/security breaches are found. Back End Testing to check if customer data and other website back end data is Functional; Can also be tested by the software Engineers. Since our Website will be used by a wide variety of customers Compatibility testing will be run by testing our Site on many different browsers and Devices.</p> 
<p>Next is the Beta Phase of Testing, when we are happy with the first stages of testing the Alpha Prototype we can move to a wider audience of testers and complete most of the same tastes as in the Alpha Stage but far more rigorous. This will be the Final Stage of Testing and therefore stress Testing occurs just before release, this includes tasks such as seeing how many users our server can handle at once and inputting large amounts of data into the website at one time to test when and how it fails.</p>
<p>Final or Full release of our Website, will still need to have Testing Parameters met, as once the up and running there will still need to be Maintenance and updated features to the website which will need their own set of Alpha and Beta Testing also known as Unit Testing, which is completed by senior programmers, as they improve the site as it continues to function and requires knowledge of the internal programming code.

									<h3>Risks</h3>
<h2></h2>
Risk is inherent in any project undertaking, whether it is an IT project or a business project.  It is vitally important that the team leader, manager, or developers can identify these risks before they happen.  It is important that someone has the responsibility to identify the risks in the project and take the proper steps to mitigate them.<br>
In the words of Duke Leto Atreides from the novel Dune “Knowing that a trap exists is the first step in avoiding it”.<br>
This philosophy towards risk is vitally important when initiating an IT team project.  <br>
What exactly is risk?<br>
Risk is defined as “a future uncertain event with a probability of occurrence and potential for loss.” (Jos, Jos and Anand, 2020)<br>
Risks can take many forms in an IT project.  There are internal and external risks.  Schedule risks, budget risks, operational risks, scope risks, technical risks and programmatic risks.<br>
These risks will apply as much to “Choice Charities” donation website as any other IT project.<br>
As university students who have not had any experience so far in a professional IT team project, we must be vigilant in trying to identify the risks in the development of Choice Charities so that they can be mitigated, further increasing the probability of its success.<br>
<br>
Risks in communication are biggest causes of failure in a team project.  A team must work coherently and have open channels of communication.  Each team member must know their place in the project so that there is a positive and productive culture.<br>
With Choice Charities, we are planning to mitigate this risk by having group meetings twice a week and taking down documentation.  Each member knows their place in the project and can be productive on their own.  If for whatever reason one of the team members had to leave the project, there would not be a massive void.  As a new member could quickly take on their responsibility or other members would be able to know exactly what needed to be done due to written documentation.<br>
<br>
Understanding the scope and limits is one of the most important parts of an entire project.  Everything must be planned in hindsight so that the project has as much chance of success as possible.  The key stakeholders must be identified.  The different roles of the team members have must be identified.  Different iterations must be established.  Also the budged must be established so that deadlines must be met.<br>
For many IT projects these constraints are all well and good at the start of a project.  But then something called scope creep happens.<br>
Scope creep is where you start off project with a set of clear, well defined requirements, but as you approach the finish line so many requirements are added or deleted that all you are left with is one big mess.  (4 Common Risks In Software Development Projects, 2020).<br>
This is big a risk that could happen to the development of Choice Charities.  It is possible that in the production of the website so many things are added and deleted that the developers do not know their roles anymore.  The technical project manager may lose sight of the flow of the project.  The senior web designer may be overwhelmed with all the programming he must do.  The research analysist who is responsible for studying, evaluating, interpreting and presenting data may lose sight of their role in the project.  This could cause chaos among the project and could quickly derail it.<br>
To mitigate the risk of scope creep it would be necessary to have constant feedback from customer feedback and product owners.<br>
<br>
Technical difficulties are another risk when it comes to an IT project.  There are 2 types of technical difficulties: hardware and software.  These technical risks would come about by improper design.<br>
With Choice Charities, some examples of technical risk would be:<br>
•	Data security –refers to the process of protecting data from unauthorized access and data corruption throughout its lifecycle. Data security includes data encryption, hashing, tokenization, and key management practices that protect data across all applications and platforms. (What is Data Security? | Micro Focus, 2020)<br>
•	Information privacy<br>
•	Large scale system implementation<br>
•	Software integration<br>
•	Compliance<br>
<br>
Some examples of software risk<br>
There is always the chance that there are bugs in the code.  This is the responsibly of the Full Stack Developer/Senior Web Designer and the Front End Web Developer/Lead Web designers.  This risk is increased when there are problems with planning, so that the coders are rushed and don’t take necessary care with the code.<br>
There could be other errors in the code so that when it is uploaded on the internet, the website crashes.  To mitigate this risk there should be extensive quality control and beta testing.<br>
<br>
Hardware risks stem from the website hosting service.  It is possible that there is always some risk that the hosting service will run into unforeseen problems and the website will not be published on the internet.<br>
<br>
Choice Charities will be a website where people can make donations to any charity of their choosing.<br>
This means that there is a massive risk of security.  When people are using their credit cards or PayPal to give donate.   It is vitally important that the website is fully secure and encrypted so that the money is securely transferred to the charity.  100% of their money must go to the charity.<br>
The website must be hacker proof.  There are many seedy people out there who like to take advantage of the vulnerable and try and grift money away from them.  This means that security is a massive risk with Choice Charities.  Again, the Full Stack Developer/Senior Web Designer and Front End Web Developer/Lead Web designers must incorporate a high level of encryption and security within the project.<br>
Another risk related to having charities is that every charity on the website must be 100% legitimate.<br>
Each charity must be thoroughly researched before it is listed on the website.  After all, this is the main purpose that the project has been incepted at its very beginning.  Each charity must be an Official Registered Charity.  Also there must be research into what percentage of donations are distributed by the charity.  For example, what percentage goes to admin fees, or advertisement.  This is highly important as it is the sole reason for this project existing in the first place.<br>
The risk that all charities are legitimate should be taken up by the research analysist.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Poor quality code is a massive risk when it come to an IT project.  Sometimes the project is underestimated, and developers rush to complete the iteration.  The code can be difficult to read and difficult for other developers to review or make changes.  (What are the 10 biggest risks in software development?, 2020)<br>
The code can be rushed and released without testing and full of bugs that could have been prevented.<br>
“Technical debt” is where developers take shortcuts when writing the code to achieve their goals faster.  (What are the 10 biggest risks in software development?, 2020)<br>
For Choice Charities technical debt is a big risk.  The A Full Stack Developer/Senior Web Designer has the potential to cause errors in the code if they are not careful.  This could be due to shifting constraints in budgeting and scope of the project.  This also applies to the technical project manager and the research analysist.<br>
When there is scope creep, this could cause the web designer to have to take shortcuts.<br>
The code for Choice Charities must be written correctly.  This is so that the website will have longevity.  Code for choice charities must be easy to maintain, understand and extend.  The code must be documented well so that if there are any new team members, they can quickly pick up where the previous coder left off.<br>
<br>
Lack of ownership is a risk that can lead to the failure of Choice Charities.<br>
With Choice Charities, lack of ownership is a risk that could lead to project failure.  Someone must be accountable for each step in the project.<br>
For whatever reason, the CEO does not take responsibly.  This would have flow on effects for the whole project including the scope and budgeting.<br>
To mitigate this risk, an experienced and diligent CEO would have to be hired.<br>
<br>
<br>
Choice Charities will face many risks, but with proper planning and with internal controls in place, we will be able to identify risks before they are a problem and will be able to mitigate them so that our project is successful.
